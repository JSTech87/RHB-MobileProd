# Flight Search Integration Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. ‚úÖ Backend & API Connection
**Status:** RESOLVED
- **Issue:** Duffel API token was present but not properly accessible in Node.js environment
- **Fix:** Added proper environment loading and token validation
- **Verification:** API connectivity test passes

### 2. ‚úÖ Duffel API Integration  
**Status:** RESOLVED
- **Issue:** No proper data transformation between app format and Duffel API format
- **Fix:** Added comprehensive transformation functions in `services/duffelApi.ts`:
  - `transformCabinClass()` - Maps app cabin classes to Duffel format
  - `transformPassengers()` - Converts passenger counts to Duffel passenger array
  - `validateSearchDate()` - Ensures dates are valid for booking
  - `transformAppParamsToDuffel()` - Complete transformation pipeline

### 3. ‚ö†Ô∏è Location Selector Mapping
**Status:** PARTIALLY RESOLVED
- **Issue:** Airport search was returning incorrect results (all queries returned Aachen airport)
- **Root Cause:** URL encoding issues with Duffel API filters
- **Fix:** Added direct airport search fallback with proper encoding
- **Remaining:** Need to implement proper text-based search for airport names/cities

### 4. ‚úÖ Flight Results Issue
**Status:** RESOLVED  
- **Issue:** SearchScreen was doing mock searches instead of calling Duffel API
- **Fix:** Updated `handleSearch()` to actually call `DuffelApiService.searchOffers()`
- **Issue:** FlightResultsScreen wasn't handling missing initial offers
- **Fix:** Added automatic search on mount when no offers provided

### 5. ‚úÖ Data Flow Issues
**Status:** RESOLVED
- **Issue:** Type mismatches between SearchScreen and FlightResultsScreen
- **Fix:** Created unified `AppSearchParams` interface and updated navigation types
- **Issue:** Date validation was missing
- **Fix:** Added proper date validation with user-friendly error messages

## Technical Improvements Made

### Enhanced Error Handling
- Added specific error codes and messages for common issues
- Improved user feedback for invalid dates, missing configuration, etc.
- Better logging for debugging API issues

### Search Flow Optimization
- SearchScreen now calls real API instead of mock timeout
- FlightResultsScreen handles both pre-loaded and on-demand search
- Added proper loading states and error recovery

### Data Transformation Pipeline
```javascript
App Format ‚Üí Validation ‚Üí Duffel Format ‚Üí API Call ‚Üí Results
```

### API Testing
- Created comprehensive test suite (`test-duffel.js`)
- Tests connectivity, airport search, flight search, and data transformation
- Validates proper date handling and error responses

## Current Status

### ‚úÖ Working
- Duffel API connectivity 
- Date validation and transformation
- Passenger count transformation
- Cabin class mapping
- Basic flight search functionality
- Error handling and user feedback

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues Remaining
1. **Airport Search Precision**: Major airports (JFK, LAX, etc.) not found due to API filter issues
2. **Zero Flight Results**: API returns 0 offers (may be token limitations or route availability)

### üîß Immediate Next Steps

1. **Fix Airport Search**:
   ```javascript
   // Current issue: URL encoding of filter parameters
   // Need to implement text-based search as fallback
   ```

2. **Investigate Zero Results**:
   - Check if using test vs live token affects availability
   - Verify route availability for test routes (JFK-LAX)
   - Consider using different test routes with known availability

3. **Production Readiness**:
   - Move to backend proxy for security (currently using live token in mobile)
   - Add proper caching for airport data
   - Implement offline fallback for airport search

## Testing Commands

```bash
# Test API connectivity
node test-duffel.js

# Test app integration  
npx expo start --go --clear --tunnel

# Check specific airport
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
     -H "Duffel-Version: v2" \
     "https://api.duffel.com/air/airports?limit=10" | head -50
```

## Key Files Modified

1. `services/duffelApi.ts` - Complete rewrite with transformation logic
2. `screens/SearchScreen.tsx` - Real API integration
3. `screens/FlightResultsScreen.tsx` - Handle missing offers
4. `services/airportSearch.ts` - Improved search fallbacks
5. `test-duffel.js` - Comprehensive testing suite

The core integration is now functional with proper data transformation and error handling. The remaining issues are primarily around data availability and search precision.
